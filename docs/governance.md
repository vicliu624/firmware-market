# Governance and Trust

This project is a firmware index and distribution entry point, not a hosting platform. Trust tiers are displayed prominently in the UI so users understand accountability.

## Trust Tiers

- Official: Maintained by this project
- Verified: Maintainer-approved publisher with a traceable identity
- Community: Anyone can submit; users must verify and accept risk

## Default Listing Rules

- Official + Verified are shown by default
- Community is collapsed behind an explicit toggle

## Maintainer Responsibilities

- Validate manifests for correctness
- Ensure trust tier assignment is accurate
- Reject entries that misrepresent origin or ownership

## Publisher Expectations

- Provide accurate URLs and SHA256 values
- Keep release notes and docs up to date
- Avoid misleading branding or claims
